Here are the three observable trends I have noticed in the data:
1. Males make up 84% of the total player count which is pretty significant.
2. Also the 15 to 29 age group makes up a large portion of all the purchases of these video games.
3. It also appears that the top spenders purchase count averages out to about 3.8 per person.
